# E-Commerce React App

This is a simple e-commerce app I created during a paired programming exercise while at CodeClan. We create a Javascript app which uses React routing.
On the Home page the available products are displayed. Further information about the products is displayed upon clicking on the "View Product Details" button. The quantity of the product can be updated and then added to the basket. 

Clicking on the basket in the top right corner of the screen will take the user to their basket, where the total price is displayed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
To install all required dependencies for the app to run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
